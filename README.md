# Overview
The assignment was comprised of a Bruteforce, Greedy and Exact Approach Methods all with different time complexities. Due to time constraints, I could only complete the Bruteforce and Greedy approach methods which resulted in an average grade.

The application is still reflective of good & useful algorithms. Bruteforce has highest time complexity and Greedy Approach with the least time complexity.
